Sales-tracker is a browser based application to track and monitor the development of sales and potential sales within your customer base.

This system allows sales managers to log interactions between themselves and customers and to track the progress of sales.

Sales-tracker enables your marketing and tele-sales departments to record and monitor valuable information on customer needs so you can best present your services and target their specific needs. The system presents this information in numerous ways such as a sales portal, and email notifications

LIVE DEMO : http://sales-tracker.appspot.com/
Note: The above link is for a stable demo, there will be many features lacking but I have to test everything before I open it up. Its better to have a basic functioning system than a system with a lot of broken features ;)

**_This system is a learning project mainly to build a better understanding of Java web technologies and the Stripes framework, I am creating this single-handedly in my own free time and of my own free will._

I plan to get a prototype up and running fast so I have something to show, after that I will return to do some technical designs and use case scenarios, since I need to learn more about UML and such!**

> I hope go gain good experience and to potentially give something back to the open source community
