The main focus of the system will be around customers. When a user logs onto the application they will be able to review their customers and check the status of any potential projects they have with them. Each customer can have multiple projects assigned to them, this will enable the user to track potential projects, then when a project is won they can continue with further projects in the future

The customer will have a status, such as the following:
  * None Specified - For those not identified / visited
  * Potential Customer - Those with meetings / proposals in progress
  * Customer - Customer won, they have 1 of your systems
